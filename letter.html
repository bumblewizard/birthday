    <p>My Beloved Husband,<br>
    So the amount of talking we do I don't think there is anything left unsaid between us. Honestly I'm writing this letter because I love the concept of letters 
and I also know that you would not like this font at all but it seemed similar to my writing though this is way more beautiful. I love you baby and this bond that we have is the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced and 
and I know my actions sometimes makes my words seem shallow I'm sorry for all of the immarturity I show and the pain you have to endure because of it 
and I'm not going to justify it it's not justifiable. I'm really sorry baby but because of those mistakes of mine dont't ever think that you or our relationship is 
not important for me. It's the most important part of my life, more like my entire life at this point and I love it the way it is our day long calls, mini arguements all the time, you very
lovingly handling all my mood swings, and the care that you have for me it's like you never stopped caring ever through all of our highs and lows.
And lets not forget you roasting and frustrating me but I love that too (this does not gives you permit to do that all the time). I have only one request from you 
please don't ever hide your feelings from me no matter what it is don't stay quiet for the sake of peace cause all we have is each other and I 
don't want us to be distant from each other emotionaly. The life that we live together is something I always dreamt of with my partner and having you is the best blessing of my life 
all I want from you is honesty and transparency. I can't lose you Athar. Wishing you the happiest birthday hubby, I love you the most my Boondi Ka Laddu.</p>

<p class="end">Love you,<br>
Yours eternally,<br>
Zawja </p>
